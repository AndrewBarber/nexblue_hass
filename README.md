## 🌟 Welcome to the NexBlue Integration!

> 🚨 **Disclaimer:** I'm not a Python developer! This project is built with enthusiasm and a lot of trial and error. Expect some "vibe coding" along the way! 😅

This unofficial integration connects your [NexBlue](https://nexblue.com/) EV charging devices to Home Assistant, allowing you to monitor and control your chargers from your smart home dashboard.

## ✨ Features

**This integration sets up the following platforms:**

| Platform        | Description                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `binary_sensor` | 🟢 Show charger connection status, vehicle connection, charging state, and error status        |
| `sensor`        | 📊 Display power, energy (session & total), current, voltage, status, and WiFi signal strength |
| `switch`        | 🔌 Control charging (start/stop)                                                               |

### Detailed Entity Information

- **Vehicle Connected**: Indicates if a vehicle is plugged into the charger
- **Charging**: Shows if the charger is actively charging a vehicle
- **Error**: Indicates if the charger is in an error state

#### Sensors

- **Power**: Current charging power in kW
- **Energy (Session)**: Energy delivered in the current charging session in kWh
- **Energy (Total)**: Total energy delivered by the charger in kWh
- **Current**: Charging current in amperes
- **Voltage**: Charging voltage in volts
- **Status**: Textual status of the charger

## 📦 Installation

### 🏆 HACS (Recommended)

1. Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed in your Home Assistant instance
2. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS:
   - Go to HACS → Integrations → ⋮ (menu) → Custom repositories
   - Enter `https://github.com/AndrewBarber/nexblue_hass` as the repository URL
   - Select `Integration` as the category
   - Click Add
3. Click on "+ Explore & Download Repositories" and search for "NexBlue"
4. Click "Download" on the NexBlue integration
5. Restart Home Assistant

### 🔧 Manual Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`)
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `nexblue_hass`
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/nexblue_hass/` directory (folder) in this repository
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created
6. Restart Home Assistant

## ⚙️ Setup

1. In the Home Assistant UI go to "Configuration" → "Integrations"
2. Click "+" and search for "NexBlue"
3. Enter your NexBlue account credentials (the same ones you use for the NexBlue app)

## 🔐 Authentication

This integration requires your NexBlue account credentials to authenticate with the NexBlue API. Your credentials are stored locally in Home Assistant and are only used to authenticate with the NexBlue API.

### Token Management

The integration handles authentication tokens securely:

- Access tokens expire after 1 day
- Refresh tokens expire after 30 days
- The integration automatically refreshes tokens when needed

### API Implementation

This integration uses the official NexBlue API endpoints as documented in their OpenAPI specification. The API specification is stored locally in the `docs/api` directory and can be updated using the provided script in `scripts/update_api_spec.sh`.

## 🚧 Work in Progress
